    <p>Ground Control to Major Tom
        Ground Control to Major Tom
        Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
        Ground Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven, six)
        Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three)
        Check ignition and may God's love be with you (two, one, liftoff)
        <strong> is Ground Control to Major Tom
        You've really made the grade
        And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
        Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare</strong>
        "This is Major Tom to Ground Control
        I'm stepping through the door
        And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
        And the stars look very different today
        For here
        Am I sitting in a tin can
        Far above the world
        Planet Earth is blue
        And there's nothing I can do
        Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
        I'm feeling very still
        And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
        Tell my wife I love her very much she knows
        Ground Control to Major Tom
        Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
        Can you hear me, Major Tom?
        Can you hear me, Major Tom?
        Can you hear me, Major Tom?
        Can you "Here am I floating 'round my tin can
        Far above the moon
        Planet Earth is blue
        And there's nothing I can do"</p>
    <p id="missao"><em>NOSSA MISSÃO É IR À MARTE!<strong><br><br>Didn't know what time it was the lights were low
        I leaned back on my radio
        Some cat was layin down some rock n roll lotta soul, he said
        Then the loud sound did seem to fade
        Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
        That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive
        
        There's a starman waiting in the sky
        He'd like to come and meet us
        But he thinks he'd blow our minds
        There's a starman waiting in the sky
        He's told us not to blow it
        Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
        He told me:
        Let the children lose it
        Let the children use it
        Let all the children boogie
        
        I had to phone someone so I picked on you
        Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
        Switch on the tv we may pick him up on channel two
        Look out your window I can see his light
        If we can sparkle he may land tonight
        Don't tell your poppa or hell get us locked up in fright
